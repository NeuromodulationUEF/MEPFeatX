There are two data in each dataset, which are the raw responses ('raw_meps') and preprocessed MEP ('meps').
Inter-trial intervals are random among 4-6 s.

1. coil_orient_FDI_resp.mat
	+ Paradigm: single-pulse TMS
	+ Target muscle: right FDI
	+ Stimulation protocol: 120 single pulses at 120% rTMS. The coil was rotated from -135 degree to 135 degree about the pre-defined optimal coil orientation.
	+ The coil orientation ('coil_info') is provided along with 'raw_meps' and 'meps'.

2. LICI_TA_resp.mat
	+ Paradigm: long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI)
	+ Target muscle: right TA
	+ Stimulation protocol: 20 bursts, each contains 2 pulses at 120% rTMS, 100 ms apart.

3. RS_TA_resp.mat
	+ Paradigm: repetitive suppression (RS)
	+ Target muscle: right TA
	+ Stimulation protocol: 20 bursts, each contains 4 pulses at 120% rTMS, 1 s apart.

4,5,6. SICF14_TA_resp.mat, SICF30_TA_resp.mat, SICF70_TA_resp.mat
	+ Paradigm: short-interval intra-cortical facilitation (SICF)
	+ Target muscle: right TA
	+ Stimulation protocol: 20 bursts. Each contains 2 pulses at 120% rTMS, and 1.4, 3.0 and 7.0 ms apart, respectively.

7. single_pulse_TA_resp.mat
	+ Paradigm: single-pulse TMS
	+ Target muscle: right TA
	+ Stimulation protocol: 20 single pulses at 120% rTMS
